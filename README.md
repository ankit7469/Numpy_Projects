In this numpy file, there is lots of operation which is performed on arrays using numpy.
And there is two projects...
1. # Project-1 ----Monte carlo pi estimation using numpy and python 
---------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Basically this project shows us how we can find the value of pi.
# 2. Just take one square which contains 10000 points inside it.
# 3. Now make an circle in it from its one corner and it almost contains 7850 points.
# 4. This projects shows probability, simulation and Numpy vectorization.
# 5. In this we learn - Random numbers with NumPy, Boolean arrays and sum, Vectorized operations (no loops!)

2. # project-2 
# Dice roll probabily estimation 
# In this we check  the probability of the sum of 2 dices (5,6,8,etc) at one time among 10000 chances.
